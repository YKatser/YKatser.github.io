					PCoE Datasets (NASA)
				</h5>
				<p>
					The Prognostics Data Repository is a collection of data sets that have been donated by various universities, agencies, or companies. The data repository focuses exclusively on prognostic data sets, i.e., data sets that can be used for development of prognostic algorithms. Mostly these are time series of data from some nominal state to a failed state. The collection of data in this repository is an ongoing process.

					(intrusion) KDD Cup 1999 Data
				</h5>
				<p>
					The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections.

				<p>
					The Tennessee Eastman process is a well-known simulated chemical process developed to provide a realistic industrial process on which to evaluate the performance of process control and monitoring methods (Russell et al. 2000b). The Eastman Chemical Company created a simulation of an actual chemical process with five major units and eight components (Downs and Vogel 1993).

					Sugar Refinery Benchmark
				</h5>
				<p>
					A fault detection and identification benchmark was developed by the Development and Application Methods for Diagnosis of Actuators in Industrial Controls Systems (DAMADICS) research training network (DAMADICS RTN 2002).
					This benchmark is based on a real sugar refinery (Cukrownia Lublin SA) in Poland, where three actuators have been modified to allow the introduction of mechanically and electrically induced faults (Bartys ́ et al. 2006). Faults were introduced under supervised conditions to prevent the sugar factory from operating outside acceptable quality limits. Both simulated models and real data are available as benchmark data for fault detection and identification. Detailed information, simulators and process data of this benchmark is available from the DAMADICS research group website (DAMADICS RTN 2002).

				<p>
					These data sets were collected from a simple single-hop and a multi-hop wireless sensor network deployment using TelosB motes. Each data set consists of correlated process parameters (e.g. humidity and temperature) collected during a 6-hour period at intervals of 5 s. The Single-hop data was collected on 9th May 2010, and the multi-hop data was collected on 10th July 2010.

					(intrusion) DARPA
				</h5>
				<p>
					Since 1999, the DARPA99 data has been the most widely used data set for the IDS evaluations that use machine learning techniques. This data set was prepared by Stolfo et al. [50] and is built based on the data captured in the DARPA99 IDS evaluation program [51]. This data set contains raw traffic flow records with an associated label to indicate whether the record was labeled as either normal or an attack. In particular, the simulated attacks fall in one of the most common types of attacks including: a Denial of Service Attack (DoS), User to Root Attack (U2R), Remote to Local Attack (R2L) and a Probing Attack. The original DARPA data sets is about 4 GB of compressed raw (binary) tcpdump data of 7 weeks of network traffic, which can be processed into about 5 million connection records, each with about 100 bytes. 
					This sample data set consists of approximately 10,000 single connection vectors each of which contains 41 attributes.

					water treatment plant (WTP)
				</h5>
				<p>
					This data set was collected from the daily measures of sensors in a urban waste water treatment plant. The objective is to classify the operational state of the plant in order to identify the abnormality through the state variables of the plant at each of the stages of the treatment process. This data set consists of 527 instances and each instance contains 38 attributes and is labeled either normal or abnormal.

				<h5>
					(intrusion) Internet Traffic Data (ITD)
				</h5>
				<p>
					the traffic data sets collected by the high-performance network monitor (described in [49]) are some of the largest publicly available network traffic traces that are used in our experiment. These data sets are based on traces captured using its loss-limited, full-payload capture to disk where timestamps with a resolution of better than 35 ns are provided. The data were taken for several different periods in time from one site on the Internet. This site is a research- facility which hosts up to 1000 users connected to the Internet via a full-duplex Gigabyte Ethernet link. Full-duplex traffic on this connection was monitored for each traffic set. The site hosts several biology-related facilities, collectively referred to as Genome Campus (Cambridge Lab). There are three institutions on-site that employ about 1,000 researchers, administrators and technical staff. This campus is connected to the Internet via a full-duplex Gigabyte Ethernet link. It was on this connection to the Internet that the monitor was placed. Each traffic set consists of a full 24 h, week-day period in both link directions.

					The Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)
				</h5>
				<p>
					The NAB corpus of 58 timeseries data files is designed to provide data for research in streaming anomaly detection. It is comprised of both real-world and artifical timeseries data containing labeled anomalous periods of behavior.

The majority of the data is real-world from a variety of sources such as AWS server metrics, Twitter volume, advertisement clicking metrics, traffic data, and more. All data is included in the repository, with more details in the <a href="https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data">data readme</a>.

					S5 - A Labeled Anomaly Detection Dataset, version 1.0(16M)
				</h5>
				<p>
					Automatic anomaly detection is critical in today's world where the sheer volume of data makes it impossible to tag outliers manually. The goal of this dataset is to benchmark your anomaly detection algorithm. The dataset consists of real and synthetic time-series with tagged anomaly points. The dataset tests the detection accuracy of various anomaly-types including outliers and change-points.
